Mud banks are unique, clearly demarked naturally occurring calm areas which occur
mainly in the inshore waters along the Kerala coast during the southwest monsoon period.
Formation of mud banks can be either just before the onset of South-West monsoon or
during the monsoon. Mud banks are popularly known as “Chakara” or “Shanthakara” (meaning
calm area) and fishermen consider mud banks as „gift of God‟ since these are safe fishing areas
for launching and berthing the fishing crafts when the rest of coastal belt is surf ridden, with high
swells and unsuitable for small scale fishing operations. Though mud banks are known to occur
in the region between Kannur and Kollam, the most popular is the Alappuzha (Alleppey) mud
bank which occurs every year.
The most important and well known mud banks are at Narakkal just north of Cochin, off
Alleppy and two smaller banks at or near Calicut. The bank at Narakkal is usually situated at the
mouth of the Periyar river and extends about 3 miles along the shore from south to north and 4.5
miles out to the sea. The mud banks at or near Calicut as well as that at Alleppey are mobile in
nature. In addition to the above four, the mud bank formation occurs at Quilandy, at Beypore,
Veliyangod, Munambam, off Cochin south of the harbour entrance, near Chellanam and near
Alleppey. These mud banks are often of an ephemeral nature appearing during some years and
absent at other times.
